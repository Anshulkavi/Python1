# 🎓 Python Tasks: Student Lookup & List Operations

Welcome! This repo contains two simple and educational Python tasks — perfect for beginners looking to practice basic **input handling**, **dictionaries**, **list slicing**, and **reversing** in Python. 🚀

---

## 📌 Task 1: 🔍 Student Marks Lookup

A console-based program that lets you enter a student's name and returns their marks from a predefined dictionary.

### 💡 Features:
- Case-insensitive name matching
- Clean output formatting
- Graceful handling for unknown names

### 📥 Input Example:

Enter the student's name: virat
📤 Output Example:

Virat's marks: 30
## 📌 Task 2: 🔁 List Slicing & Reversing
This program demonstrates how to:

Generate a list from 1 to 10

Slice the first 5 elements

Reverse those sliced elements

### 📤 Sample Output:

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
🛠️ How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed.

#### Run Task 1
python task1.py

#### Run Task 2
python task2.py

🧠 Concepts Covered
Python input() and string methods

Dictionary usage

Conditional logic

List slicing and reversing
